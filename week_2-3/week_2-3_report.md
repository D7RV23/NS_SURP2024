SURP Week 2-3 Report

Objective:

  *Learn the governing equations of Neutron Stars, and to solve them
  
What I learned:

  *The different Equations that explain the existance of Neutrons Stars to our understanding.
  
  *Using the Pickle Packages. 
  
  *Implementing all the code in this Git Repository, really helps out with keeping information easly available, and letting me work on any of my devices.
  
Challenges:
  *Python has still being a thron on the side due to always thinking code in C++,and Java syntax
  
  *Pickle being confusing at times, and finding documentation for the package

The endgoal at the end will be to end with Neutron Star models that are realistic enough, and as such we need the foundation to build the models. The goal of the upcoming 2 weeks will be to fully learn these governing equations, along with being able to solve them in Python scripts.
