SURP Week 2-3 Report

Objective:

  *Learn the governing equations of Neutron Stars, and to solve them
  
What I learned:

  The different Equations that explain the existance of Neutrons Stars to our understanding.
  
  Using the Pickle Packages. 
  
  Implementing all the code in this Git Repository, really helps out with keeping information easly available, and letting me work on any of my devices.
  
Challenges:

  Python has still being a thorn on the side due to always thinking code in C++,and Java syntax
  
  Pickle being confusing at times, and finding documentation for the package

The endgoal at the end will be to end with Neutron Star models that are realistic enough, and as such we need the foundation to build the models. The goal of the upcoming 2 weeks will be to fully learn these governing equations, along with being able to solve them in Python scripts.

Tasks:

Task 0: Reading required Material (Completed)

 While I went over the given texbook chapters, In order to get a better understanding I would have to probably go back, and take more notes on them.

Task 1: Read the Pickle File (Completed)

 The most dificult part regarding the pickle file was finding the documentation on it online, along with pulling the required material from it, after it was pulled then it became more easy to work with it.

Task 2:Writing the Subroutines for finding pressure from density, and density from pressure (completed)

 most of the work that came from this was figuring out how to work with the pickle file, and Proffesor Shin Chi really help with the Psudo code 

Task 3:Developing the Euler Method Solver (In Progress)

 making the model turned out to be easier that what was expected,I was ovthinking the problem
